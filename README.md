# TIC TAC TOE #
This is an object orientated version of a simple tic tac toe game with some features such as name input, marker selection and a win tally.

## HOW TO PLAY ##
Insert the two player names, choose your marker, and start the game. Select a box to place your marker in. The winner is the player who gets three straight markers in a row in any direction.

## TECH ##
The project was built with Javascript, using Jquery for DOM manipulation and some Underscore.js inside the logic. The winner is calculated by generating an array of numbers with unique 9-bit values and iterating through them to find a winning combination.

## POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES ##
It would be great to add sound effects to the click events using the DOM. Also, a footer would be a visual bonus.
